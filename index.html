   <h2>My Ten Best Coding Modules</h2>
    
    <h2><a href ="">Module 1 "Intro to JS"</a></h2>
    <p><a id = "hodu"> I will continue using the knowledge i've learn from this module, when I start making more programs Im going to be making more and more objects. From khan academy , I was able to learn new stuff about object i didn't know before and I programs so I wouldn't have known as much I would if not for Intro to JS. The most benefitial part about this was learning how make custom functions to make multiples and to just change the value of them. </a> </p>
    
    <h2><a href =" ">Module 2 "Intro to HTML"</a></h2>
    <p>HTML is going to be a very important piece of my future career since , I might need to make a website and learning the basics on how to do that will be very helpful to me. Learning things from basic css to lists, links and images to stylise the modules into my liking.</p>
